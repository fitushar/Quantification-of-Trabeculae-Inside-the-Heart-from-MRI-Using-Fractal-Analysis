# Quantification-of-Trabeculae-Inside-the-Heart-from-MRI-Using-Fractal-Analysis
Left ventricular non-compaction (LVNC) is a rare
cardiomyopathy (CMP) that should be considered as a possible
diagnosis because of its potential complications which are heart
failure, ventricular arrhythmias, and embolic events. For analysis
cardiac functionality, extracting information from the Left
ventricular (LV) is already a broad field of Medical Imaging.
Different algorithms and strategies ranging that is semiautomated or automated has already been developed to get useful
information from such a critical structure of heart. Trabeculae in
the heart undergoes difference changes like solid from spongy. Due
to failure of this process left ventricle non-compaction occurred.
In this project, we will demonstrate the fractal dimension (FD) and
manual segmentation of the Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)
of the heart that quantify amount of trabeculae inside the heart.
The greater the value of fractal dimension inside the heart
indicates the greater complex pattern of the trabeculae in the
heart.
